			<p>If you don't already know,there are many 
			bees and many types of them, too (around 20,000 species)! In general, they can be found all over the world.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p><h2>Here are the main types of bees and their functions</h2></p>
		
			<table>
			
			<tr>
			<p> <h3>Honey Bees</h3><br>
			<td><img src = "images/honeybee.jpg" alt="Image of Honey Bee"></td><td>
			Honey Bees live in the hives and create the honey that we consume. They are smaller than bumble bees, and sometimes
			may be confused for wasps or hornets. Like some human social systems, honey bees work in a caste system. <ol>
				<li>Queen Bee (female): Typically stays in one spot, gives birth to the larvae to maintain the population of the hive</li>
				<li>Worker Bee (female): tend to the queens needs (food, water, etc. as well as protecting the larvae)</li>
				<li>Drone Bee (male): go out and find flowers to pollinate</li>
				</ol>
			Honey Bees typically do not sting unless they feel that their hive is threatened. They will pursue you
			in long distances if need be, so be careful!</td>
			</p>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
			<p> <h3>Bumble Bees</h3><br>
			<td><img src = "images/bumblebee.jpg" alt="Image of Bee"></td><td>
			You likely see this bee the most. This bee flies around looking for pollen in flowers to take back to the hive!
			They typically have little interest in stinging people unless they are disturbed.</td>
			</p>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
			<p>The remaining bees are just more examples of the different types of ways bees live, but they aren't
			as important to the purpose of this document, nor are they known to sting as much:</p>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
			<p> <h3>Leafcutter/Mason Bees</h3><br>
			<td><img src = "images/masonbee.jpg" alt="Image of Bee"></td><td>
			These bees are known for cutting small disc shapes out of leaves and using them to add to their homes.</td>
			</p>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
			<p> <h3>Digger/Carpenter Bees</h3><br>
			<td><img src = "images/carpenter bee.jpg" alt="Image of Bee"></td>
			<td>As their name suggests, these bees like to dig! They typically live underground.</td>
			</p>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>	
			<p> <h3>Mining Bees</h3><br>
			<td><img src = "images/miningbee.jpg" alt="Image of Honey Bee"></td>
			<td>These bees create complex tunnels and nests underground. They love loose soil!</td>
			</p>
			</tr>
